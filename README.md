# Dominoes

## About
Have you ever wanted to code a game where the computer is your enemy? Well, this little project allows you to do just that.
Take turns playing classic dominoes against your computer in a race to victory.
Learn, how artificial intelligence can make use of simple statistics to make educated decisions. This project is all about basic concepts, put them to practice by making a fun little game.

## Learning outcomes
This project is all about basic concepts. You'll work with strings, tuples, lists, conditional statements, and more.

## Stages:
### :white_check_mark: Stage 1/5: Setting Up the Game
Create and distribute the domino pieces between the players and the stock. Decide which player will make the first move.
### :white_check_mark: Stage 2/5: The Interface
A good game should have a decent interface. Create a user-friendly output section.
### :white_check_mark: Stage 3/5: Taking Turns
Bring the game to life. Allow players to take turns until the "end game" condition is met.
### :white_check_mark: Stage 4/5: Enforcing Rules in Dominoes
A game should have rules. It's time to introduce them.
### :white_check_mark: Stage 5/5: The AI
Random choices are hardly a sign of intelligence. Teach your computer to make educated decisions with the help of basic statistics.
